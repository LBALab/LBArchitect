LBA 1 Script weirdnesses:

1. END_COMPORTEMENT in the middle of actual comportement
2. SET_COMPORTEMENT references an inexisting comportement (i.e. a comp. that does not start after end of previous comportement).
3. GOTO -1 in Track Scripts, which probably means the same as STOP
4. SET_COMPORTEMENT -1 in Life Scripts
5. SET_COMPORTEMENT that points to the END in Life Scripts
6. Two or more LABELs in a TrackScript have identical IDs (GOTO points to the last one).
