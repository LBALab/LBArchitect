Nov 24, 2006 Version 1.5.0 Prerelease
  - WARNING WARNING WARNING: A bug was discovered in the streaming of the Collection Items (the core class for 
    Items, Groups and Columns).  I had to fix it to make the streaming extendable in the future.. and now.  
    I extended TEasyColumn in the last release so that means that all designtime AND persistent streams that 
    contain the ELV Header information will crash on start up.  The problem is the wrong stream version was written
    to the stream so there is no way to identify it on read in.  It will give a stream read error when it is loaded.
    I can't apologize enough for this mistake, it will be a painful upgrade.
  - Fixed bug in the Collection Editor that caused a random AV in the IDE if the ELV was deleted


Nov 23, 2006 Version 1.5.0 Prerelease
  - OnCustomView event has been renamed to OnItemCustomView and OnGroupCustomView and OnColumnCustomView added.  
    this will break your DFM file sorry... but it had to be changed.
  - Some internal renaming of classes, for the TEasy... prefix
  - Reworked the way the default views were stored.  They are no longer stored a static properties they
    call the new event handlers and dynamically callback everytime they are needed
  - This means the way the View property works.  This should fix the issue in the last SVN update
  - TEAsyColumn.AutoToggleSort has been renamed to TEAsyColumn.AutoToggleSortGlyph to more accurately reflect
    what it does.  It should translate to the new property in the DFM without notice
  - There is a new property TEasyColumn.AutoSortOnClick.  This causes the Sorter to sort the list if the 
    header is clicked even if the ELV.Sort.AutoSort is False.
  - Added TEasyBaseTaskBand.AutoScrollPanels to allow for the scroll bars of the panels to be shown or 
    not used if the band is smaller then the Panel
  - Fixed a bug in the Theming with the TaskPanels
  - Fixed bug in NavigateItemInternal, gave an AV under special conditions
  - Added default parameter to DeleteSelected
      procedure DeleteSelected(SelectPrevItem: Boolean = False);
  - Added:
      function CanMoveDown: Boolean;
      function CanMoveUp: Boolean;
      function MoveDown: Boolean;
      function MoveUp: Boolean;
     to allow selected items to be moved up or down.  Make sure AutoSort is off.  

Nov 12, 2006 Version 1.5.0 Prerelease
  - YOU MUST UPGRADE THE COMMON LIBRARY TO VERSION 1.5.0 FIRST..............................
  - Renamed and moved IEasyExtractObj to ICommonExtractObj in the Common Library Package
  - Moved and renamed the follow to the Common Library Package 
       TWideStringDynArray to TCommonWideStringDynArray
       TIntegerDynArray to TCommonIntegerDynArray;
       TEasyFormatEtcArray to TCommonFormatEtcArray  
       TEasyVAlignment to TCommonVAlignment
  - Number of renamings to support the above changes
  - Added new component TEasyTaskPanelBand see the TaskPanel demo.
      New panels are created in the File > New > Other... and the "New" tab under "EasyListview TaskPanel"
  - New demo for the TEasyTaskPanelBand
  - Moved the EasyDataObject into the Common Library Package (CommonDataObject)
  - Added new Gradient "glass effect" (similar to vista) for item selection, see the Overview Demo.
  - Added an OnPaintBkGnd event for custom painting of the background, see to Overview Demo.
  - Added properties to the ELV.Background object to allow for text to be shown in the background,
      see the Overview demo.
  - Added OnClipboardXXXX events to handle custom clipboard actions
  - Changed the way the focus rectangle was drawn to be consistent with VirtualTreevew
  - Fixed issues with Column captions and fonts, caused a lot of "C..." with plenty of room for the text.
  - Added option to hide the caption in Thumbnail and Filmstrip views (ELV.PaintInfoItem.HideCaption)

Oct 8, 2006
  - Published the Tag property in the stored collection items
  - Added SetSize to TEasyCellSize
  - Minor fixes
  - Fixed bug with ContextMenu hotkeys
  - Fixed problem with Compilers.inc 
  - Fixed bug with context menu showing after right mouse drag/drop
  - Fix for flicker if selection when drag selecting
  - Added TNTSUPPORT compiler define to Options.inc to enable unicode-aware inplace editors.
  - Fixed bug with context menu showing after right mouse drag/drop
  - Added an ELV.Selection.SelectedToArray method to return the selected items in an array
  - Added an ELV.Selection.DeleteSelected method
  - Major internal change to adding/deleting items.  For large data sets the speed of the control
    may be significantly slower.  This is because the items are reindexed for every addition
    and deleting of an item for robustness under all conditions.  This can be manually shutoff
    with the new property ReIndexDisable.  For instance:

         ELV.Items.ReIndexDisable := True;
         try
           // Add the items here
         finally
           ELV.Items.ReIndexDisable := False
         end

          or 

         ELV.Groups.ReIndexDisable := True;
         try
           // Add the items here
         finally
           ELV.Groups.ReIndexDisable := False
         end;
    
  - Added SpTBX support for painting.  Need to add the conditional define "SpTBX"
  - Fixed bug when setting a custom PaintInfo object to an Item
  - Fixed bug where drag selection would unselect item if the selection rect was (0, 0, 0, 0);
  - Reworked the order for when the LosingSelection, LosingFocus, and LosingVisiblility
    was being called during an item destruction.  Should make it more robust.
  - Fixed problem with grouping and disabling reindexing
  - Added OnItemMouseDown/Up events
  - Fixed some painting bugs in Thumbnail view.
  - Added internal streaming versioning to update stream without invalidating older streams
  - The Edit method now takes a column parameter. This will put different columns into edit mode in report view.  
    This is not a great solution since there is no visual feedback that you can actually put the columns into edit mode
  - MakeVisible now functional for the columns in ReportMode
  - Added FirstVisibleColumn, NextVisibleColumn, PrevVisibleColumn, LastVisibleColumn to the Header object
  - Added support for Grid Lines in ReportView, see the PaintInfoItem.GridLines and GridLineColor.
  - Added support for hilighting the columns in Report and Grid Mode
      property HilightFocused: Boolean
      property HilightFocusedColor: TColor 
  - Fixed bug with new support for grid lines
  - Fixed Demos to compile with latest changes
  - Fixed bug with GroupExpand and Collapse Events
  - Fixed but introduced lat release with column header captions
  - Added CacheDoubleBufferBits property, it is off by default (different then prev version).  
     If true the bitmap for the background is cached to the current window size.  
     Has a speed advantage at the expense of memory usage.
  - Changed the sorting to have a Sort.BeginUpdate/EndUpdate to keep from sorting redundantly
  -  Fixed the String Editor so it is an Edit for single line caption views and TMemo for Multiline views.
  - Added event to allow application to supply the text for the initial edit string
  - Fixed bug that showed the wrong context menu in report view on the last item if the header was shown
  - Fixed the ELV.Group.ReIndexDisable property to actually work :^)
  - Gave the details view a 2 pixel margin on top to not "blend" into the Header
  - Simplified the code to resize the string edit box
  - Updated Main Demo to compile with new code.
  - Minor enhancements (SelectFirst method added)
  - Bug fixes for last column not resizing if invisible column is the last in the List
  - Added default parameter to Sort.SortAll to force it to sort regardless of the update Count
  - Added default value for published property Selection.MouseButtonSelRect
  - Fixed bug if OLE drag and drop when dragging the headers


July 28, 2006
  - Complete rework of the component structure, EasyListview now requires the
    new MustangPeak Common Library components to be installed first.
    Most issues can in compiling existing EasyListview code can be solved by replacing 
    any missing unit in your compile with...
    
    uses
      MPCommonUtilities, MPCommonObjects, MPShellTypes;

    If you are using TWideFileStream or TWideStringList I suggest you use the Tnt Unicode package
    available from 

    http://www.tntware.com/delphicontrols/unicode/

    There is no point in me duplicating this work.

    Any function used in the old VirtualUtilities or VirtualWideStrings that ended with a "W" is now
    like the Tnt functions and begin with "Wide"
      
      FileExistsW is now WideFileExists
      ect...    
      DirExistsW is an exception it maps to WideDirectoryExists

    If any object that use to be called TVirtualXXXXX or TEasyXXXX it is likely now 
    called TCommonXXXXX and in the MPCommonObjects.pas file of the Mustangpeak 
    Common Library Package.

    Other issues that may be noticable at design time are:

      An invalid stream read on a MouseButton type.  This was a misspelling so just 
    ignore it.  You may have to reset the mouse buttons that will allow a drag 
    select for nondefault buttons (left, right).

    TEasyKeyStates => TCommonKeyStates
    TEasyDropEffects => TCommonDropEffects
    TEasyDropEffect => TCommonDropEffect

    edeCopy, edeMove, edeLink => cdeCopy, cdeMove, cdeLink 
    edeNone, ..... edeScroll => cdeNone, ..... cdeScroll

    THDrop => TCommonHDrop

    TEasyMouseButton => TCommonMouseButton


May 28, 2006
  - Added ELV.paintInfoItem.ShowBorder to not show a border
    on views with Borders.
  - Added TEasyAlphaBlender.BasicBlend with the same parameters 
    as the old blend method.

May 27, 2006
  - Added OnItemSelectionsChanged to notify when item selection
    has changed in volumn.  OnItemSelectionChange is fired for
    every item that changes selection state.  This new event
    only fires once when 1 or a block of items has changed
    selection in one action (SelectAll for instance), Mantis #87
  - Finished implementing the Hot-Tracking.
  - TaskBand Hot-tracking now works as in Explorer, Mantis #83

May 26, 2006
  - Release of version 1.0.0 Beta
  - Added new component TEasySrollButton for more interesting 
    scrolling options.  See the ThumbScroller Demo.
  - Bug fixes.
  - UPdated the component structure to allow descendants to more
    easily hide unwanted properties.

May 22, 2006
  - Fixed bug when deleting items and the scrollbar was not at 0.
  - Added new TEasyTaskBand component that closely mimics the 
    ExplorerBand in Windows Explorer XP.

May 18, 2006
  - Added to Tcolumn
       - property AutoSizeOnDblClk;
       - property AutoSpring;
    AutoSizeOnDblClk resized the column to fit all captions if doubled clicks in
    resize area of the header.
    AutoSpring works like in VT.  The columns try to stay in the same proportion
    to other columns as the window is resized.

May 15, 2006
  - Fixed bug in CustomDrawing TEasyAlphaBlender
  - Added MergeSort to TEasySortManager, Code donated by Milan
  - Fixed memory leak with AutoGroupSort
  - Made Interfaced Sorting more robust to unallowed mixed item types
    (with interfaced sorting ALL items must be of type TEasyInterfacedXXXX)

May 14, 2006
  - Resizing Column would fire and AutoSort, fixed
  - Image not clipped if column was at minimum width, fixed
  - Added to TEasyListview
      property DisabledBlendAlpha; 
      property DisabledBlendColor;
    for blending of image when item is disabled.
  - Added to TEasySelectionManager
      property BlendAlphaTextRect
    for blending of selection rectangles on text
