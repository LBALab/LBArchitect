Since this release no external components are required to build LBArchitect. All
necessary components are already included (in the Components directory) and are
created at run time, so they don't have to be installed in the IDE.
 
 This program can edit Grid files which contain rooms and islands in
 Little Big Adventure 1 and rooms in LBA 2.
 It can also edit Scene files containing active environment elements of the LBA world.
